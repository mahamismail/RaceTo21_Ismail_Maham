        /*********************** FEATURE TO DO *******************************
        Only the winning player earns points equal to their score that round. 
            o Players who went “bust” lose points equal to their hand total minus 21. 
            o Players who “stay” earn no points for the round. 
            o Game ends when one player reaches an agreed-upon score (for example, 100 points) or after an 
            agreed-upon number of rounds. 
        
        SO FAR:
        - Set a public int for overall Score in Player class called gameScore
        - Made gameScore additions and subtractions in the function showFinalScores()
        - Created enum Task ShowBigScore
        - Created function ShowOverAllScore, which when called writes to console and displays player's overall game score.
        - This function is called when Task is set to ShowBigScore
        - Set task to ShowBigScores once all players are introduced.
        - Set task to ShowBigScores once CheckForEnd is true and once someone has won or gone bust (Probably after GameOver?); then move forward.
        
        BUG: 
        - ShowOverAllScore() is not being recognized in the Game class when Task is ShowBigScore.
